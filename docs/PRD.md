# PRD - Co-Lab Test

### **Problem**

Students often struggle to find and connect with peers who are in the same classes or share similar academic/project interests, making collaboration and peer support harder than it needs to be.

---

### **User**

Undergraduate and graduate students seeking academic collaboration, study groups, or project partners.

---

### **Value Metric**

% of active users who successfully connect with at least one peer within 7 days of sign-up.

---

### **Happy Path**

A student logs in, selects their current/past courses and interests, and gets matched with peers for potential collaboration or study.

---

### **Acceptance Criteria**

1. **Given** a new user logs in, **when** they authenticate with a school email, **then** they are prompted to enter courses and interests.
2. **Given** a user has entered courses/interests, **when** they view suggestions, **then** they see a list of students with shared courses or overlapping interests.
3. **Given** a user views a suggested profile, **when** they choose to connect, **then** a connection request is sent.
